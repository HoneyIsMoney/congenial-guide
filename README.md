## About The Project

This branch is entitled to showcase how you can get started integrating/using [Diamond Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) in terms of upgradability and interaction with facets of a diamond. 

## Getting Started


### Installation

Let's start our environment for tinkering and exploring how NFT auction would work.

1. Clone the repo first
```sh
git clone -b payment-channel https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git payment-channel
cd payment-channel
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```
3. Start local chain
```bash
yarn chain
```

4. Start your React frontend
```bash
yarn start
```

5. Deploy your smart contracts to a local blockchain
```bash
yarn deploy
```

## Smart contracts

Let's navigate to `packages/hardhat/contracts` folder and check out what contracts we have there.

The [facets folder](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/tree/diamond-starter-kit/packages/hardhat/contracts/facets) has test the facets of the diamond including the [Diamond Cut Facet](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/blob/diamond-starter-kit/packages/hardhat/contracts/DiamondCutFacet.sol) and we are mostly interested in this.

#### Diamond Cut Facet
So basically there is just 1 main function:

- ```function diamondCut(FacetCut[] calldata _diamondCut, address _init, bytes calldata _calldata) external ``` responsible for upgrading facets, _init and _calldata can be set as [zeroAddress](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) and '0x' , the FacetCut struct basically consists of the updated facet address(zeroAddress when you want to remove a selector), the action you want to perform diamond standard offers 3 basic actions (Add, Replace and Remove) and the array of selectors which are just function signatures that are being added/updated/removed.

- NOTE -> Upgradability only works for facets which were initially deployed with the diamond



## Practice

Firstly, get us some funds using local faucet.

Select the type of upgrade action you want to perform

Upload the updated abi of the facet contract you wish to upgrade, you can get the updated abi by running ```yarn compile``` after updating the contract in artifacts folder

Deploy the new facet, in case of add or delete action specify the exact selector details as mentioned in the placeholder and clicking on upgrade will essentially upgrade the diamond!
